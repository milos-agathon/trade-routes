# Trade routes
In this repo, I'll show you how to use the United Nations Comtrade database, which contains over 1.5 billion records of trade flows between countries. You'll learn how to use ggplot2 in R to create great circles that show the trade relationships of the largest wheat exporters in 2022. 

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to create your own trade routes maps for any commodity, country, or year.

In specific, you'll be able to create trade route maps for a single country like the one below.

Also, you'll be able to label the top importers.
